# Analytics Dashboard Project - Preparation Phase Progress

## Project Overview
Adding PostgreSQL database and shadcn frontend for data analytics to existing HubSpot MCP server.

**Key Requirements:**

- Analytics tracking for tool usage (BCP + individual tool metrics)
- Error monitoring with raw JSON logs
- Railway platform deployment

## Phase Progress

### ✅ Phase 0: Documentation Setup
- Created project tracking file
- Verified existing documentation structure

### ✅ Phase 1: Prepare (Research & Documentation)
**Status**: Completed

**Research Areas:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL Integration Patterns
- ✅ Analytics Requirements Deep Dive  
- ✅ shadcn UI and Frontend Architecture
- ✅ Railway Deployment Specifics
- ✅ Authentication Approaches
- ✅ Integration with Existing MCP Server

**Completed Deliverables:**
- ✅ `postgresql-integration.md`
- ✅ `analytics-requirements.md`
- ✅ `shadcn-dashboard.md`
- ✅ `railway-deployment.md`
- ✅ `authentication-system.md`
- ✅ `integration-patterns.md`

### ⏳ Phase 2: Architect (System Design)
**Status**: Ready to begin

### ⏳ Phase 3: Code (Implementation)
**Status**: Pending completion of Architecture phase

### ⏳ Phase 4: Test (Quality Assurance)
**Status**: Pending completion of Code phase

## Key Findings

### Technology Stack Recommendations
1. **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe operations and Railway compatibility
2. **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with shadcn/ui components and Recharts for data visualization
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing and session management
4. **Deployment**: Railway platform with managed PostgreSQL and automated CI/CD
5. **Analytics**: Non-intrusive middleware patterns with batch logging for performance

### Critical Implementation Patterns
1. **Database Schema**: Partitioned tables for high-volume analytics data with JSONB for flexible parameter storage
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket streaming for live dashboard metrics
3. **Security**: Comprehensive rate limiting, security headers, and data sanitization
4. **Performance**: Async batch processing and materialized views for dashboard queries
5. **Integration**: Middleware-based request/response logging without disrupting core MCP functionality

### Architectural Insights
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep analytics as optional, non-intrusive layer
2. **Scalability**: Design for high-frequency logging with efficient aggregation strategies
3. **Maintainability**: Use established patterns (Prisma, shadcn/ui) for long-term support
4. **Security**: Implement comprehensive authentication with proper session management
5. **Observability**: Include performance monitoring for the analytics system itself

## Decisions Made

### Core Technology Choices
- **ORM**: Prisma selected for TypeScript integration and Railway compatibility
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui chosen for modern component architecture and customization
- **Chart Library**: Recharts selected for React compatibility and shadcn/ui integration  
- **Authentication**: Hybrid JWT/session approach for optimal security and usability
- **Deployment**: Railway platform for managed services and developer experience

### Database Design
- Table partitioning by date for tool usage logs (performance optimization)
- JSONB columns for flexible parameter and error context storage
- Materialized views for common dashboard aggregations
- Separate error logging table with full context capture

### Security Approach
- bcrypt password hashing with minimum 12 salt rounds
- JWT access tokens (15 min expiry) with refresh token rotation
- Comprehensive rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Data sanitization for sensitive information in logs

## Next Actions
1. **Architecture Phase**: Begin system design based on research findings
2. **Component Design**: Create detailed technical specifications for each system component
3. **Implementation Planning**: Define development phases and integration points
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Plan Railway configuration and environment setup

## Research Summary

The preparation phase has identified a robust, scalable solution architecture:

**Frontend**: Modern React dashboard with shadcn/ui providing beautiful, accessible components and comprehensive chart capabilities for analytics visualization.

**Backend**: Non-intrusive analytics integration using Express middleware patterns to capture tool usage without impacting core MCP server performance.

**Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM providing type-safe operations, with carefully designed schema optimized for analytics workloads and data retention policies.

**Security**: Multi-layered authentication system with JWT tokens, secure session management, and comprehensive security middleware.

**Deployment**: Railway platform offering managed PostgreSQL, automated deployments, and excellent developer experience for the complete stack.

The research has validated the technical feasibility and identified specific implementation patterns that will ensure a successful, maintainable, and scalable analytics dashboard solution.
