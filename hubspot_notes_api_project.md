# HubSpot Notes API Integration Project

**Project Manager:** Project Management Team  
**Created:** May 11, 2025, 3:04 PM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)  
**Status:** Notes Service Implementation Completed

## 1. Project Overview

The HubSpot Notes API Integration project aims to extend our existing HubSpot MCP (Model Contehttps://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api/crm/engagements/notesxt Protocol) server to support the Notes API, enabling the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of notes associated with various HubSpot objects (contacts, companies, deals, etc.). This integration will follow our established Bounded Context Pack (BCP) architecture pattern.

## 2. Current Project Architecture

Our HubSpot MCP server currently implements the following BCPs:

| BCP | Status | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| BlogPosts | Implemented | Manages blog post operations (create, read, update, delete, list) |
| Companies | Implemented | Manages company operations (create, read, update, delete, search, recent) |
| Contacts | Implemented | Manages contact operations (create, read, update, delete, search, recent) |
| Notes | In Progress | Managing note operations and associations (service layer implemented) |

The system follows a clean architecture with:
- Core services and types (`src/core/`)
- Bounded Context Packs for each domain (`src/bcps/`)
- Tool-based implementation for each operation

## 3. Notes API Requirements

Based on the HubSpot API documentation and our existing architecture, the Notes API integration will require:

### 3.1 Core Functionality

- **Create Notes**: Create notes associated with HubSpot objects
- **Retrieve Notes**: Get notes by ID or associated object
- **Update Notes**: Modify existing notes
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes from the system
- **List Notes**: Retrieve notes with filtering options

### 3.2 Association Functionality

- **Object Associations**: Link notes to contacts, companies, deals, tickets, etc.
- **Association Types**: Support different association types and categories
- **Batch Operations**: Support batch creation and updates for efficiency

### 3.3 Best Practices

- Follow existing BCP architecture pattern
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Ensure type safety throughout the implementation
- Add comprehensive documentation for each tool
- Create unit tests for all operations

## 12. Architecture Design

### 12.1 Notes BCP Architecture

The Notes API integration has been implemented with the following components:

#### 12.1.1 Service Layer

The Notes BCP includes a dedicated service layer (`notes.service.ts`) that:

- Provides a clean interface to the HubSpot Notes API
- Handles authentication and API communication
- Implements error handling
- Manages data validation and transformation
- Includes support for listing and filtering notes

The service extends the base service class and implements the following methods:

```typescript
export class NotesService extends HubspotBaseService {
  // Core CRUD operations
  public async createNote(input: NoteCreateInput): Promise<Note>;
  public async getNote(id: string): Promise<Note>;
  public async updateNote(id: string, input: NoteUpdateInput): Promise<Note>;
  public async deleteNote(id: string): Promise<void>;
  public async listNotes(filters?: NoteFilters): Promise<NotesPage>;
  public async getRecentNotes(limit: number = 10): Promise<NotesPage>;
  
  // Association operations (planned for Phase 2)
  // public async associateNote(noteId: string, objectType: string, objectId: string): Promise<void>;
  // public async disassociateNote(noteId: string, objectType: string, objectId: string): Promise<void>;
  // public async getAssociatedNotes(objectType: string, objectId: string): Promise<NotesPage>;
}
```

#### 12.1.2 Specialized Tools

The Notes BCP will include the following specialized tools:

1. **Core CRUD Tools**:
   - `create.tool.ts`: Create new notes
   - `get.tool.ts`: Retrieve notes by ID
   - `update.tool.ts`: Update existing notes
   - `delete.tool.ts`: Delete notes
   - `list.tool.ts`: List notes with filtering

2. **Association Tools**:
   - `associate.tool.ts`: Associate notes with HubSpot objects
   - `disassociate.tool.ts`: Remove associations
   - `getAssociated.tool.ts`: Get notes by associated object

3. **Batch Operation Tools**:
   - `batchCreate.tool.ts`: Create multiple notes in one operation
   - `batchUpdate.tool.ts`: Update multiple notes in one operation

### 12.2 Extension Points for Existing Operations

The architecture includes extension points for existing Contact operations:

1. **Contact Note Integration**:
   - Extend the Contacts BCP to include note-related operations
   - Add methods to the Contacts service for retrieving associated notes
   - Create new tools for contact-specific note operations

2. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Add new tools to the Contacts BCP: `getNotes.tool.ts`, `addNote.tool.ts`
   - These tools will leverage the Notes service but provide a contact-centric interface
   - Maintain separation of concerns while enabling seamless integration

### 12.3 Association Functionality

The architecture defines a robust association system between Notes and other HubSpot objects:

1. **Association Types**:
   - Standard associations (default)
   - Categorized associations (with specific types)
   - Bidirectional associations (where applicable)

2. **Supported Object Types**:
   - Contacts
   - Companies
   - Deals
   - Tickets
   - Custom objects (where supported by HubSpot)

3. **Association Operations**:
   - Create associations
   - Delete associations
   - Query by associations
   - Batch association operations

### 12.4 Interface Definitions

The architecture includes the following interface definitions:

```typescript
// Note interfaces
export interface Note {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: string;
  ownerId: string;
  associations?: NoteAssociation[];
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

export interface NoteCreateInput {
  content: string;
  ownerId?: string;
  associations?: NoteAssociationInput[];
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

export interface NoteUpdateInput {
  content?: string;
  ownerId?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

// Association interfaces
export interface NoteAssociation {
  objectType: string;
  objectId: string;
  associationType?: string;
}

export interface NoteAssociationInput {
  objectType: string;
  objectId: string;
  associationType?: string;
}

// Filtering and pagination
export interface NoteFilters {
  ownerId?: string;
  startTimestamp?: string;
  endTimestamp?: string;
  limit?: number;
  after?: string;
}

export interface NotesPage {
  results: Note[];
  pagination: {
    next?: string;
  };
}
```

### 12.5 Implementation Guidelines

The architecture specifies the following implementation guidelines:

#### 12.5.1 Type Safety

- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Implement strict type checking throughout the codebase
- Validate API responses against defined interfaces
- Use generics for reusable components

#### 12.5.2 Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive error handling at the service layer
- Categorize errors (network, authentication, validation, etc.)
- Provide meaningful error messages and codes
- Implement retry logic for transient errors
- Log errors with appropriate context

#### 12.5.3 Testing

- Unit test all service methods with mocked API responses
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Implement integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Use test fixtures for consistent test data
- Aim for >90% code coverage

## 13. Test Plan and Implementation

The Tester has completed comprehensive tests for the HubSpot Notes API core functionality. These tests have guided the implementation of the Notes service layer, following a test-first development approach. The tests have been successfully executed and all tests are passing.

### 13.1 Test Strategy

The test strategy follows these key principles:

1. **Test-First Development**: Tests are designed before implementation to ensure requirements are clearly understood and testable
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all core functionality and edge cases
3. **Isolation**: Service layer and tools are tested in isolation with appropriate mocking
4. **Validation**: Tests validate both successful operations and error handling

### 13.2 Service Layer Tests

The `notes.service.ts` tests have been implemented and cover:

1. **Core CRUD Operations**:
   - `createNote()`: Tests creating notes with various input combinations
   - `getNote()`: Tests retrieving notes by ID, including error cases
   - `updateNote()`: Tests updating notes with different field combinations
   - `deleteNote()`: Tests deleting notes, including error cases
   - `listNotes()`: Tests listing notes with various filter combinations
   - `getRecentNotes()`: Tests retrieving recent notes with default and custom limits

2. **Association Operations**:
   - `associateNote()`: Test associating notes with different object types
   - `disassociateNote()`: Test removing associations
   - `getAssociatedNotes()`: Test retrieving notes by associated object

3. **Error Handling**:
   - API errors
   - Validation errors
   - Authentication errors
   - Rate limiting scenarios

### 13.3 Tool Tests
